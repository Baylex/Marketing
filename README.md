# But Can She Manage Socials?!?!?

## TikTok
In April 2024, I started working with Britt on his TikTok account.  His goal is to monetize TikTok to replace his day job income.       
He started with 3k followers and has grown to 12k followers as of July 2024, 3 short months.        
He has 2 videos over 1M views. 

Watch his growth!

## Websites
I work on various websites, many are in the early stages of building as I have free time to dedicate to passion projects, volunteering my skills to support my community. 

1. [Transformation Waco](https://transformationwaco.org/) 
2. [Move Up Games](https://moveupgames.net/)
3. Coming Soon!  Mt. Olive Cemetary Association

## Facebook Pages and Groups
[Fig + Broccoli: A Raccoon Quest](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091671555849) I made these games with a group that chose not to monetize the game.  I claimed the socials and have not pushed them for the games.

# But Can She SEO Rank? 
Sure!  Don't believe me. Let's do a test and prove it!               
Google search: Baylex      
How many of my socials came up?           
I should have 4 or more positions on page 1 and my logo ranks as well.
